    <h1>About the project</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Conceptualization</h2>
        <p>At the onset of the pandemic when public transportation was suddenly shut down, an unfortunately phenomenon
            took place across Nepal. Large numbers economic migrants were trapped, often without work and income, in locations other
            than their homes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            That many people were stuck in the Gulf or at the India border was unfortunate but not surprising. For many years now
            the media, the arts etc have highlighted the stories of that large number of migrant workers that travel outside Nepal
            for economic activity. What was more surprising was the number of people that were economic migrants inside the country. <br><br>

            These stories prompted me to look for data on internal migrant and to understand the causes of it. 
        </p>

        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>
            The best and most reliable source for data was the Nepal Census of 2011. Unfortunately there were several issues with the data.
            <br> <br>
            First, most of the data was only available from official sources in PDF format. However, <a href="https://opendatanepal.com/"> Open Data Nepal </a> 
            fortunately had done much of the work of extracting data from PDF and making it available in CSV format. After locating the relevant
            CSV files. I converted them to a JSON using Notepad and used <a href = "https://jsonlint.com/"> JSON Lint </a> to verify formatting.        
        </p>

        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>
            In doing the coding I largely relied on the Mozilla Developer Network website and Stackoverflow to work through problems. 
            Initially I struggled with two major issues. First, I was very uncomfortable using annonmous functions. Given my previous training
            in older, more rigid programming languages they felt strange. By the end of the project though I think I sorta grew comfortable with them.
            <br><br>
            The other very important things I learned from this project was how to manipulate arrays. Since there was a lot of independent rows of data That
            needed to be turned into a grid format... there was a lot of iterating and selecting from arrays. I felt like I got a decent grasp
            of some of the ES6 type code to manipulate array. I think those are super cool cause you can do a lot of stuff that would take nested for-loops etc 
            in a single line of code. 
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            My own critique of the project matches what was given to me in feedback during presentation. The project prioritized the functional elements
            and missed out on visual communication. I suspect this came from both my initial struggles with figuring out how to use JS 
            as well as me trying to solve too many technically interesting problems. In future projects, I want to start a bit earlier with the coding 
            so that I get technical issues out of the way quickly. And perhaps seperate out more time to think about both visualization and also the use of CSS.
